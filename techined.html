        <h2 class="teched-title">Technology in Education</h2>
        <p>Technology is an amazing resource to use in education that can help educators introduce new content, review content, assess and monitor students' understanding of concepts, and much more.  However, it's important to remember that technology is just another tool in the educators' toolbox.</p>
        <p>When designing instruction it's important for educators to determine what they want their students to learn, explore, and/or be able to do before deciding which tools will help them to be effective and efficient in helping students learn.  Searching for resources, new ideas, learning how a piece of technology works, etc. can be time consuming, so I'm going to highlight a few websites, blogs, and applications that are amazing resources.</p>
