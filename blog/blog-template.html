How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
My pair and I decided to create our own wireframes.  I shared the wireframe I had created for the blog index and modified it for the blog post template so the designs flowed together.  My partner created a sketch that included some different elements and we compared our wireframes.  As we discussed the differences in our wireframes we talked about which elements we should use in our blog template and which elements could be added on later.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I found wireframing to be very beneficial in the development process as it allows you to rework your ideas before writing any code.  As well, you can decide on which elements best fit the layout of the content in your wireframe.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided that a simple layout that focused on the main content and how the user will interact with that page made a good wireframe.  We made sure to include a header, navigation bar, a section for the blog post, an aside, and footer with copyright information.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Throughout the week I’ve been learning about semantic elements by using HTML5 Doctor, *HTML & CSS* by Jon Duckett, and googling so I’m aware of when and where to use many of the elements.  I found the websites http://docs.cmsmadesimple.org/layout/design-manager/templates/basic-html5-example-template and http://www.webcodegeeks.com/html5/html5-page-structure-example/ to be helpful in understanding the structure of html5.  However, I’m still unsure about when and where to use the div element.  When looking at examples and source code I’ve seen it used to wrap all the elements in the body, all the elements after the header in the body, and/or around several sections in the body.
